# MERN Task Manager

This is a **Task Manager** application built using the **MERN** stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). The app allows users to register, log in, and manage their tasks. Tasks can be created, updated, deleted, and marked as completed. The app uses **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for user authentication and authorization.

## Features

- **User Registration**: Users can register an account with their email and password.
- **User Login**: Allows users to log in and receive a JWT token for authenticated sessions.
- **Task Management**:
  - Create tasks
  - Update task status (complete/incomplete)
  - Delete tasks
- **Protected Routes**: Only authenticated users can access their tasks.
- **JWT Authentication** for secure login and session management.

## Requirements

- **Node.js** (v14 or higher)
- **MongoDB** (Local or Atlas)
- **Postman** (for testing API requests)
